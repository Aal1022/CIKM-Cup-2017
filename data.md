### Data Description
> The dataset contains real radar map information and the rainfall amounts of different sites collected by meteorological observatory centers. The dataset covers several dimensions as follows:
      a. Each radar map contains one target site that located at the centre of the map;
      b. A radar map may be labeled with a target site’s rainfall amount between future 1-hour and 2-hour. Note that, we don’t consider to predict rainfall amount within the future 1-hour in this task.
      c. Radar maps are measured at different time spans, i.e., 15 time spans with an interval of 6 minutes, and different heights, i.e., 4 heights, from 0.5km to 3.5km with an interval of 1km; 
      d. According to the latitude and longitude of a target site, each radar map covers an area of 101*101km2 around the site. The area is marked as 101*101 grids, and the target site is located at the centre, i.e. (50, 50).
The data is illustrated as follows:
